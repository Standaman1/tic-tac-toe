# tic-tac-toe

Here is a link to my extremely original game of tic-tac-toe. Feel free to play. Free of charge!
https://github.com/Standaman1/tic-tac-toe.git

In this game you battle your friend (or enemy) in the thrilling game of tic-tac-toe. You choose a colour and your friend choose a colour and then it's game on!
Will you go middle? Will the other person go top corner? Will you mix it up and go middle left? The possibilities are endless! (Disclaimer: Actually it isn't you can only get 255,168 combinations of the game).

The main feature is the lovely selection of colours you can have. Since there are so many colours, I have enhanced the user and player experience by only giving each player two to choose from so you can spend less time on deciding if you want hot pink or golden rod yellow and more time on the riveting game that is TIC TAC TOE!! The other feature is how to start the game without any prompts so it's sort of like a escape room where you aren't given all the tools to succeed beause the only tool that is required is your creativity and problem-solving abilities in figuring out how to start the game (Disclaimer: Definitely not because I ran out of time). 

In regards to the bugs, please refer to the features paragraph above. Also the rubbish bin icon is a red herring (not the colour) in the sense that when you click it, absolutely nothing happens because it was a placeholder for me to put in icons to represent each players moves in the square.

The tech used in this game is Javascript, HTML, jQuery and CSS. 

In regards to my wishlist, I would like to have a selection of colours for each player and each time a square is clicked, it randomises the colour from that available to each player with a timer for each move so it becomes a memory game as well just to spice things up. I would also like to put an overlay on top to prompt the user to select a colour as well as their own name for the game. I would also like the win screen to be a bit better than just saying the player won.
